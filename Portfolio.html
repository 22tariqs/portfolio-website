				<p class = "para"> I am currently an undergraduate <b> student at SUNY Albany, pursuing a major in Informatics with a concentration in Software Development, alongside a minor in Mathematics. </b>
			
				As a research assistant, I am actively collaborating with a PhD student to develop and publish a research proposal, honing my skills in critical analysis and academic writing.

				In addition to my academic pursuits, I am involved in various organizations, including Women in Coding and Ma'rifa.
			
				In my free time, I enjoy tutoring beginners in Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and elementary statistics, sharing my passion for coding and data with others.

				Outside of academics, I value spending quality time with family and friends, traveling, photography, and engaging in my local community.
			
				My aspiration is to work as a data analyst, where I can leverage my skills to derive insights from data and contribute to impactful projects.
